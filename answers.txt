Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: We might consider using git because it helps manage code and data changes while 
working with a team in (remote) project collaboration.


Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: A field that data science can be applied to is Transportation. Specifically, with
automated, AI-operated, self-driving automobile technology on the rise, data science is
vital in this field as it helps improve the accuracy of the self-driving technologies
being developed, that allow the vehicle to become even more reliable and safe. Therefore
data science is important, because machine learning plays a large role in this process,
and being able to understand the data through data science practices is therefore equally
important and can be helpful in improving the technology. Ultimately, data science can be
heavily applied in development process of AI-automated self-driving technology in
Transportation vehicles and help in bettering the technology.


Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: The difference between merging and rebasing is that merging is safer since it 
preserves the repository branch history while adding the commit in, whereas rebasing 
rewrites the branch history when adding in a commit.
